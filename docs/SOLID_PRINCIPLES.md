## What is SOLID?

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**"A class should have only one reason to change."**

**Our Implementation:**
- **Models** handle only data access and relationships
- **Services** handle business logic
- **Resources** handle only UI/presentation logic

### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**

**Our Implementation:**
- Using **interfaces** allows adding new implementations without changing existing code
- **Service layer** can be extended with new services without modifying existing ones

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**"Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting correctness."**

**Our Implementation:**
- Any implementation of interfaces can be used interchangeably
- Mock implementations can replace real ones in tests

### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use."**

**Our Implementation:**
- Focused interfaces for specific capabilities
- `AuthorizationServiceInterface` - Only authorization methods
- `WorkflowLockingInterface` - Only locking methods
- `TaskProgressionInterface` - Only progression methods

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**"Depend on abstractions, not concretions."**

**Our Implementation:**
- Code depends on **interfaces**, not concrete classes
- Laravel's service container handles dependency injection

## Service Layer Architecture

### 1. Authorization Service

**Interface:** `App\Contracts\Services\AuthorizationServiceInterface`

**Implementation:** `App\Services\Authorization\AuthorizationService`

**Responsibilities:**
- Check user permissions for resources
- Apply tenant scoping to queries
- Validate action permissions
- Handle impersonation logic

### 2. Workflow Locking Service

**Interface:** `App\Contracts\Services\WorkflowLockingInterface`

**Implementation:** `App\Services\Workflow\WorkflowLockService`

**Responsibilities:**
- Lock/unlock milestones
- Check if milestones can be modified
- Lock entire system templates
- Cache locked milestone data

### 3. Task Progression Service

**Interface:** `App\Contracts\Services\TaskProgressionInterface`

**Implementation:** `App\Services\Task\TaskProgressionService`

**Responsibilities:**
- Progress tasks through milestones
- Validate progression requirements
- Calculate completion percentages
- Handle task state transitions

## Usage Examples

See DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md for detailed usage examples.

## Best Practices

### DO

1. Use services for complex business logic
2. Keep models thin
3. Inject dependencies via constructor
4. Use interfaces, not concrete classes
5. Write tests for services

### DON'T

1. Put business logic in models
2. Use concrete classes directly
3. Skip interfaces for services
4. Mix concerns in services
