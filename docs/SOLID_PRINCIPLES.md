# SOLID Principles Implementation Guide

This document explains how SOLID principles have been applied to the Commatix codebase to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class should have only one reason to change.

### Examples in Codebase:
- `WorkflowLockService` handles only workflow locking operations
- `TaskProgressionService` manages only task progression logic
- `WorkflowExportService` focuses solely on export functionality

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Implementation:
- Strategy pattern for task progression
- Interface-based design for workflow operations
- Plugin architecture for export formats

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

### Implementation:
- Consistent interface implementation across tenant types
- Proper inheritance hierarchies in model classes

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

### Implementation:
- Fine-grained interfaces for workflow operations
- Role-specific interfaces for different functionalities

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

### Implementation:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection for service dependencies
- Interface-based contracts between layers

## For Future Developers

When working with this codebase:

1. **Check interfaces first** - Look for the contracts that define expected behavior
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Use the same architectural patterns when adding new features
3. **Respect SRP** - If a class grows too large, consider splitting it
4. **Use dependency injection** - Always inject dependencies rather than instantiating them directly
5. **Write tests** - Each service should have corresponding unit tests

## Key Directories to Explore:

- `app/Services/` - Business logic implementations
- `app/Repositories/` - Data access abstractions
- `app/Interfaces/` - Contract definitions
- `tests/` - Unit and feature tests

## Common Patterns Used:

1. **Service Pattern** - Business logic separated from models
2. **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstraction
3. **Strategy Pattern** - Algorithm selection at runtime
4. **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling between components
